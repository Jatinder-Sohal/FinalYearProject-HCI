Folder Structure
This Readme will explain the folders in this final submission. To find out how to deploy my projects please read the Installation Manual in my report - Section 9.1.

In this folder there are 3 interfaces. Due to React's requirments these folders are written in lowercase. Following this standard I named my Android application in a similar fashion.

The first interface is finance_tracker, which is a React project that contains package files, src, public and documentation files. The src contains the main files for the project, with public just containing boilerplate for launching the project.

My second interface project_planning has the same folder structure. The src however does not contain any pages folder due to it being a single page application.

The third interface is cooking_companion and its directory looks a lot different due to it being a Jetpack Compose project. The src files are located in app/src/main. There are pages and components inside there, similar to the finance_tracker.

My final Report is named as Jatinder.Final.pdf and can be found in the root directory as a seperate pdf.

There are two text files also in the root. One is the full diary and the other contains a link to a youtube video which shows the functionality of my interfaces.

The last item in the root folder is Documents. This contains 3 more folders inside 1)Sketches - my prototypes 2) Documentation of all my code 3) User testing for the final week of my project.

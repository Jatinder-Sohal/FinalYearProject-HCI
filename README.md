Folder Structure
At this point in time, I have 4 folders with 2 containing the interfaces I have created, this being finance_track and project_planning. The other 2 folders contain my reports and sketches as named.


Project planning application
This folder project_planning contains 3 folders: main, test and resources. We can run the application by opening Main.py inside the main folder and pressing f5. But please make sure you have the required libraries installed.

The test folder contains test files the correspond to files in main. They can also be run by opening them and pressing f5.

The resources folder contains images that the main and test uses in its python files.

Required libraries can be installed using pip. The reader just needs to google the library pip installation and it will come up. Some of these libraries include: Tkinter, Custom Tkinter, TKtooltip, and PIL

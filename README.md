Folder Structure
This Readme will explain the folders in this final submission. To find out how to deploy my projects please read the Installation Manual in my report - Section 9.1.

In this folder there are 3 interfaces. Due to React's requirments these folders are written in lowercase. Following this standard I named my Android application in a similar fashion.

The first interface is finance_tracker, which is a React project that contains package files, src, public and documentation files. The src contains the main files for the project, with public just containing boilerplate for launching the project.

My second interface project_planning has the same folder structure. The src however does not contain any pages folder due to it being a single page application.

The third interface is cooking_companion and its directory looks a lot different due to it being a Jetpack Compose project. The src files are located in app/src/main. There are pages and components inside there, similar to the finance_tracker.

Sketches contain all my prototypes for my interfaces. There were created before my implementations and contain screenshots of both Canva and Figma.

The documentation folder contains React doc and  for my applications. I have hoisted these files outside so they are easier to access.

The final user testing folder contains my last iteration of user testing and the results from that.

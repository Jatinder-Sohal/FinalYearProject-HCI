Folder Structure
I have created 2 interfaces at this point in time. The first is the folder financial_tracker and the second becing project_planning

--Finance tracker website
The folder financial_tracker contains several different files and folders.

To deploy the project, you will first need to install npm and node.
After this you just need to navigate inside the financial tracker folder and type: npm install.
This will install all the required dependancies.

To run the project, once inside the financial tracker type: npm start
And to test the project, type: npm test  - After 30 seconds a test suite will appear type: a -This will run all tests

--Project planning application
The folder project_planning contains 3 folders: main, test and resources. You can run the application by opening Main.py inside the main folder and pressing f5. But please make sure you have the required libraries installed (Check bottom).

The test folder contains test files the correspond to files in main. They can also be run by opening them and pressing f5.

The resources folder contains images that the main and test uses in its python files.

REQUIRED LIBRARIES: Each library can be installed using pip. The libraries include: Tkinter, Custom Tkinter, TKtooltip, and PIL

Week 2 (2/10/23)
Completed:	-first draft of Project plan and have sent to supervisor to get his opinion on my plan.
		-In this plan discussed some technologies like JavaFX, Django, spring boot, react 
		-Have completed some basic HCI reading for my abstract description learning about why usability is so important and some basic rules.           

Problems: 	-Tough to cover such a massive subject and convert this into a few paragraphs
		-Many types of technology that have their own advantages and my knowledge is especially great for any of them
	
Future: 	-do more research to cut down technologies to what I am actually going to use for the interfaces
		-Continue reading about HCI and add to paragraphs for final draft

Week 2 (06/10/23)
Completed:	-Good foundation reading of HCI learning about the balance of functionality and usability, accessibility issues, basic colour theory and a few HCI principles.
		-Researched and decided the technologies I will be using: Javafx, bootsrap and Springboot

Problems	-It was tough to decide the technologies and I still might have to change them if I can't learn or adapt to using them fast enough
		-Had to add more to nearly all aspects to my report due to feedback from supervisor

Future:		-Begin setting up the html to run a page - will use visual studio live coding extension
		-Start adding in libraries that will allow me to create elements

Week 3 (11/10/23)
Completed:	-Created home page for first UI adding navigation bar, background image, fitting colour schemes, buttons and text to direct the user
		-Set up framework spring boot to add some basic functionality to the website and allow it to communicate with the database

Problems 	-Haven't adapted elements for minimizing yet and so some remain fixed while others move.	
		-Tough to create a design that looks good for everyone after getting feedback. Some like one design and others prefer another.

Future:		-Get feedback from supervisor at next meeting
		-Add some functionality to home page and begin working on another page for the first user interface
		-Read up on accessibility from books and articles online

Week 3 (15/10/23)
Completed:  	-Nearly finished fixing elements for the bug discussed in problems.
		-Fixed indentation of css and jsp file
		-Completed sketch of enter data page using canva

Problems	-Discovered bug in home page where minimizing doesn’t affect all elements the same and some are off screen. 
		-Sketched elements will be tough to create, for example a pie chart that updates when entering data - may need to redo sketch 

Future: 	-Set up enterData page and begin coding. Need to add table, colour scheme, title, navbar again.
		-Add navigation link from home page to enter data page

Week 4 (18/10/23)
Completed:	-Nearly finished enter data page adding features which were described last week
		-Read some basic features about accessibility e.g Image annotations, logos, page readers etc

Problems:	-Couldn't add a good title to the page, spent a lot of time experimenting with different fonts and sizes - looks very amateurish 
		-Not sure if I need to do tdd or create a uml as it says one thing on Moodle but other people are saying we don’t.

Future:	 	-Add some basic functionality to enter data page
		-Begin working on other pages
		-Implement researched accessibility if I have time and also carry on research on different rules.

Week 4 (22/10/23)
Completed:	-Refactored design of enter data page as I wasn't happy with the design, especially the bootstrap items and so redid the code using vanilla html and css.
		-Added extra features like sidebar content, more buttons for the table and improve colour scheme.

Problems:	-Pushed back implementation of accessibility even more and development of other pages
		-Haven't added functionality to the page as will be quite time consuming and just added dummy data to the table - not sure if I will be penalised for this.

Future:		-Finally begin other pages and finishing up with this application
		-Start a bit of the write up about this implementation and how I used HCI rules
		-Implement accessibility features (might do after finishing application)

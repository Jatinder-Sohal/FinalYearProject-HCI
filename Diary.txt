Week 2 (2/10/23)
Completed:	-first draft of Project plan and have sent to supervisor to get his opinion on my plan.
		-In this plan discussed some technologies like JavaFX, Django, spring boot, react 
		-Have completed some basic HCI reading for my abstract description learning about why usability is so important and some basic rules.           

Problems: 	-Tough to cover such a massive subject and convert this into a few paragraphs
		-Many types of technology that have their own advantages and my knowledge is especially great for any of them
	
Future:	 	-do more research to cut down technologies to what I am actually going to use for the interfaces

		-Begin working on other pages
		-Implement researched accessibility if I have time and also carry on research on different rules.

Week 4 (22/10/23)
Completed:	-Refactored design of enter data page as I wasn't happy with the design, especially the bootstrap items and so redid the code using vanilla html and css.

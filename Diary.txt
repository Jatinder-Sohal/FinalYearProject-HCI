Week 2 (2/10/23)
Completed:	-first draft of Project plan and have sent to supervisor to get his opionion on my plan.
		-In this plan discussed some technologies like javafx, django, springboot, react 
		-Have completed some basic HCI reading for my abstract description learning about why usability is so important and some basic rules.

Problems: 	-Tough to cover such a massive subject and convert this into a few paraghraphs
		-Many types of technology that have their own advanatages and my knowledge is especially great for any of them

Future: 	-do more research to cut down technologies to what I am actually going to use for the interfaces
		-Continue reading about HCI and add to paragraphs for final draft

Week 2 (06/10/23)
Completed:	-Good foundation reading of HCI learning about the balance of functionality and usability, accessibility issues, basic colour theory 						 and a few HCI principals.
		-Reasearched and decided the technologies I will be using: Javafx, bootsrap and Springboot

Problems	-It was tough to decide the technologies and I still might have to change them if I can't learn or adapt to using them fast enough
		-Had to add more to nearly all aspects to my report due to feedback from supervisor

Future:		-Begin setting up the html to run a page - will use visual studio live coding extension
		-Start adding in libraries that will allow me to create elements

Week 3 (11/10/23)
Completed:	-Created home page for first UI adding navigation bar, background image, fitting colour schemes, buttons and text to direct the user
		-Set up framework springboot to add some basic functionality to the website and allow it to communicate with the database

Problems  	-Haven't adapated elements for minimizing yet and so some remain fixed while others move	
		-Tough to create a design that looks good for everyone after getting feedback. Some like one design and others prefer another.

Future:		-Get feedback from supervisor at next meeting
		-Add some functionality to home page and begin working on another page for the first user interface
		-Read up on accessibilty from books and articles online

Week 3 (15/10/23)
Completed:  	-Nearly finished fixing elements for the bug discussed in problems.
		-Fixed indentation of css and jsp file
		-Completed sketch of enter data page using canva

Problems	-Discovered bug in home page where minimizing dosent affect all elements the same and some are off screen. 
		-Sketched elements will be tough to create, for example a pie chart that updates when entering data - may need to redo sketch 

Future: 	-Set up enterData page and begin coding. Need to add: table, colour scheme, title, navbar again.
		-Add navigation link from home page to enter data page

Week 4 (18/10/23)
Completed:	-Nearly finished enter data page adding features which were described last week
		-Read some basic features about accessibiltiy e.g Image annotations, logos, page readers etc

Problems:	-Couldn't add a good title to the page, spent a lot of time experimenting with different fonts and sizes - looks very amteruish 
		-Not sure if I need to do tdd or create a uml as it says one thing on moodle but other people are saying we doont.

Future: 	-Add some basic functionality to enter data page
		-Being working on other pages
		-Implement researched accessibility if I have time and also carry on research on different rules.

Week 4 (22/10/23)
Completed:	-Refactored design of enter data page as I wasn't happy with the design, espically the boostrap items and so redid the code using vanilla html and css.
		-Added extra features like sidebar content, more buttons for the table and improve colour scheme.

Problems:	-Pushed back implementation of accessbility even more and development of other pages
		-Haven't added functionality to the page as will be quite time consuming and just added dummy data to the table - not sure if I will be penalised for this.

Future:		-Finally begin others pages and finishing up with this application
		-Start a bit of the write up about this implementation and how I used HCI rules
		-Implement accessiblity features (might do after finishing application)

Week 5 (25/10/23)
Completed:  	-Finished help page and started display data page
		-Found how to use WAVE accessiblity tool and have been planning on how to organise pages to include more hci principals

Problems:	-My friend got feedback from his meeting, in which he was reprimanded for using html which is what I have used.
		-Falling behind in schedule and need to start report

Future:		-Learn react
		-Need to convert all my html code to react code, so that I am able to get all available marks for complexity
		-Need to finish last page of application
		-Start report

Week 5 (29/10/23)
Completed: 	-Learnt react in a short space of time
		-Finished converting code to react 
		-Finished last page of application

Problems:	-Didnt realise css pages overlapped, had to spent huge amounts of time fixing that
		-My whole timeline is a mess right now

Future:		-Start 2nd UI

		-Make good progress on report


Week 6 (31/10/23)
Completed: 	-Research online about different java guis and found javafx to be more appropriate
		-Set up development enviroment
		-Started early development

Problems:	-Don't have access to last years javafx videos, had to do research to learn how to set it up

Future:		-Start development of lists and cards

Future		-Countinue development adding help tipes and icons to icon box
		-Start working out how interaction will happen and how to add cards




Week 7 (9/11/23)
Completed: 	-Decided to switch language to tkinter as javafx was very inflexible and I didnt like the look of my UI
		-Added several elements: Navbar, lists, 2 cards and buttons to move between lsits

Problems:	-Had to learn tkinter while implementing this UI

Future		-Continue adding functionality
		-Go back to old ui and add functionality to that as well and test it
		-Keep writing report
